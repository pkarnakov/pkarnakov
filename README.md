# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a researcher in scientific computing, developing software and algorithms for simulating complex
physical systems (fluids, bubbles, drops, and particles) on
supercomputers, and now blending them with machine learning tools to solve
inverse and control problems.
Currently working at [Harvard SEAS](https://cse-lab.seas.harvard.edu/people/petr-karnakov) in Cambridge, MA, United States.

You can see highlights of my work at [pkarnakov.com](https://pkarnakov.com),

* mathematical model (mechanics, calculus, differential equations)
* discretization (numerical methods, linear algebra)
* software implementation (C++, Python)
* high-performance computing (MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL, vectorization, x86 assembly)
* project tools (CMake, CI/CD, Docker)
* inverse and control problems (optimization, machine learning, TensorFlow, Bayesian inference)
* publishing and communication (LaTeX, scientific writing, oral presentation)
* visualization, slides, and demos (ParaView, Keynote, reveal.js, JavaScript, HTML)

I have collaborated with over 20 fellow researchers from several institutions around the globe (US, Switzerland, Germany, France, Russia)
and presented my work at 8 international conferences.

### ODIL | [code](https://github.com/cselab/odil) | [article](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae005)

ODIL (Optimizing a DIscrete Loss) is a method for solving inverse problems for partial differential equations,
which is orders of magnitude faster than PINN (physics-informed neural networks).

### Aphros | [code](https://github.com/cselab/aphros) | [article](https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abm0590)

Aphros is a distributed multiphysics solver for simulating multiphase
flow with bubbles and electrochemical reactors.
The solver performed first-ever simulations
of foaming by breakup and mixing of air in water.
