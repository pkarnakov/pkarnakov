# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a researcher in scientific computing, developing software and algorithms for simulating complex
physical systems (fluids, bubbles, drops, and particles) on
supercomputers, and now blending them with machine learning tools to solve
inverse and control problems.
Currently working at [Harvard SEAS](https://cse-lab.seas.harvard.edu/people/petr-karnakov) in Cambridge, MA, United States.
