# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a researcher developing software and algorithms for simulating complex
physical systems (fluids, bubbles, drops, and particles) on
supercomputers, and now blending them with machine learning tools to solve
inverse and control problems.
Currently working at [Harvard SEAS](https://cse-lab.seas.harvard.edu/people/petr-karnakov) in Cambridge, MA, United States.

You can see highlights of my work at [pkarnakov.com](https://pkarnakov.com),

and watch some of my simulation videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@pkarnakov).

Skills
</summary>
The field of scientific computing is multidisciplinary and highly collaborative.
My skills to fulfill each aspect of this work:

* mathematical model (mechanics, calculus, differential equations)
* discretization (numerical methods, linear algebra)
* software implementation (C++, Python)
* high-performance computing (MPI, OpenMP, OpenCL, vectorization, x86 assembly)
* project tools (CMake, CI/CD, Docker)
* inverse and control problems (optimization, machine learning, TensorFlow, Bayesian inference)
* publishing and communication (LaTeX, scientific writing, oral presentation)
* visualization, slides, and demos (ParaView, Keynote, reveal.js, JavaScript, HTML)

I have collaborated with over 20 fellow researchers from several institutions around the globe (US, Switzerland, Germany, France, Russia)
and presented my work at 8 international conferences.
